# Respiro
An Apple Application that guides users through a breathing meditation of their choice and tracks their progress through several metrics

## Important Paths 
`Respiro/Respiro/ContentView.swift` is where all the majority of the code for this project lies

## Intent
I created this app because I oftentimes find myself seeking a quick meditation to complete between Pomodoro-method cycles in order to stay focused. The current apps on the appstore don't offer the amount of customization that I desired, so I decided to make my own.
