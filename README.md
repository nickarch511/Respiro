# Respiro
An Apple Application that guides users through a breathing meditation of their choice and tracks their progress through several metrics

## Important Paths 
`Respiro/Respiro/ContentView.swift` is where all the majority of the code for this project lies

## Intent
I created this app because I oftentimes find myself seeking a quick meditation to complete between Pomodoro-Method cycles in order to stay focused. The current apps on the Appstore don't offer the amount of customization that I desired. As an example, I wanted to be able to create my own music and images that I could meditate to, which obviously isn't a capability of any current apps on the Appstore. So I decided to create my own app. I used Affinity Photo and GarageBand to create all the images and sounds in the app. 

## How it Works
This app consists of a main screen which is a TabView that holds three breath practices per page. Users can click on a breath practice and choose how much time they wish to meditate for and the app will guide that with both visual and audio cues.
